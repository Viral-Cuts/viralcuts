Welcome to the LabLab.ai AI Agents Hackathon 2.0 GitHub repository! üöÄü§ñ Here, we present our innovative solution to the challenges posed by YouTube's overwhelming statistics and time-consuming video editing processes. Our AI Agents aim to simplify video editing, cater to the short format trend, and facilitate seamless uploads to various social media platforms like YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter.

## Problem Statement

The world of YouTube is booming, with approximately 3.7 million videos uploaded every day, and a staggering 114 million active channels. However, video editing remains a time-consuming task, and the algorithms for short videos can often be confusing. To stay relevant and engage with diverse audiences, content creators need to upload short-format videos across multiple social media platforms.

## Solution - AI Agents üòéüôå

We present two powerful AI Agents as part of our solution:

### Agent 1 - Video Editor

This AI Agent utilizes the "YouTube Transcript" tool to automate the process of cutting clips and generating engaging video content.

### Agent 2 - Critique

The Critique Agent scores clips using advanced algorithms, ensuring that the content meets high-quality standards and maximizes audience engagement.
